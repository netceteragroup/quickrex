		<a name="reLibViewDetails"><h2>The Reg. Exp. Library View</h2></a>

		<p>If the Plugin is installed, you should find a view named <strong>Reg. Exp. Library</strong> offered under <strong>Window > Show View > Other...</strong> 
		in the category <strong>QuickREx</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>The view looks as displayed in the screenshot below.</p>
		
		<img alt="The Reg. Exp. Library View" src="images/RELibView.png"></img>
		
		<a name="structure"><h3>Structure of the library</h3></a>

		<p>The Regular Expression Library contains <strong>'Books'</strong> which in turn contain <strong>'Categories'</strong> 
		which hold <strong>'Regular Expression Entries'</strong>. Initially, the library only contains one book named 'QuickREx'. 
		This book is read-only, you can not delete it or change its name/path nor can you add or change categories or entries.</p>
		
		<a name="defaultContent"><h3>The initial library-contents</h3></a>
			    
		<p>The contents of the default book are displayed in the screenshot below:</p>
		
		<img alt="The default book" src="images/reLibDefaultBook.png"/></img>
			    
		<p>The entries can be used as a starting point fo your own expressions, or as they are. They are partly collected from
		public sources, partly changed or written for the plug-in.</p>
		
		<p>The default book contents can not be changed through the standard processes (i.e. from within the plug-in). However,
		since they are held in an .xml-file, you could adapt them to your needs. However, as you will shortly see, there is a 
		better way to keep track of your own useful expressions.</p>
		
		<a name="workingRE"><h3>Working with Reg. Exp. entries</h3></a>
		
		<p>If you select an entry in one of the default books' categories and right-click, the context-menu displayed
		below opens.</p>

		<img alt="The Reg. Exp. Library RE-Entry-Context menu" src="images/reLibEntryContextMenuRO.png"/></img>

		<p>You from here you can either bring up an editor to display the entries details by selecting <strong>'View'</strong> (you could also do this
		by double-clicking the entry), or you can use the entries expression and test-text directly in the QuickREx-view
		(see <a href="quickRExView.html">here</a>) by selecting <strong>'Use in QuickREx-View...'</strong>. Note that any contents
		in the QuickREx-View are overwritten by this. Global flags and the RE-implementation as selected are unchanged.</p>

		<p>Since the default book is read-only, the other menu-entries are disabled in that book.</p>
		
		<p>The editor for the library-entries is shown in the following screen-shot.</p>
		
		<img alt="The RE-Entry Editor" src="images/reLibEntryEditor.png"/></img>
		
		<p>The editor and the library-tree in the view can be linked as usually with Eclipse-views and editors (use
		the menu or the cool-bar of the library-view).</p>
		
		<p>For all books other than the default book (see <a href="#addingBook">below</a> for how to add your own books),
		the entries can be edited. In this case, the context-menu looks as follows:</p>

		<img alt="The Reg. Exp. Library RE-Entry-Context menu" src="images/reLibEntryContextMenu.png"/></img>

		<p>'View' is replaced by <strong>'Edit...'</strong>, which again opens an editor with the currently selected entry, 
		the entry can be deleted using <strong>'Delete...'</strong>, and you can add an entry following the currently selected one
		by using <strong>'Add Reg. Exp. entry'</strong>. This last option will open a dialog asking you for a title for the entry
		and then open a new editor with the title already entered. Note that titles must be unique within  category.</p>

		<p>In the QuickREx-editor, the field for entering the regular expression also offers TAB-completion (just as the QuickREx-view
		does). The TAB-completion is realized with the same mechanism as for the QuickREx-view, so the remarks made <a href="completions.html">here</a>
		about how TAB-completion is customizable apply.</p>

		<a name="searching"><h3>Searching the Library</h3></a>
		
		<p>You can search the library using the cool-bar or the menu-action of the library-view (see screenshot on top of page).
		Clicking on the search-action  brings up the following dialog:</p>
		
		<img alt="The Reg. Exp. Library Search-Input Dialog" src="images/reLibSearchInputDlg.png"/></img>

		<p>In this dialog, you can enter the search-phrase and decide which parts of the library-entries
		should be searched. Search-results are displayed in the usual Eclipse search-result view as shown below.</p>
		
		<img alt="The Reg. Exp. Library Search-Result View" src="images/reLibSearchResult.png"/></img>

		<a name="addingBook"><h3>Adding a new Book to the library</h3></a>
		
		<p>For keeping your own collection of useful regular expressions, you can add books to the regular 
		expression library. To do so, use the wizard contributed under <strong>'File &gt; New &gt; Other...'</strong> in
		the category <strong>'QuickREx'</strong> as shown in the screenshot below.</p>
		
		<img alt="The Wizard contributed by the Reg. Exp. Library" src="images/createRELibBookWizard.png"/></img>

		<p>The wizard has a single page asking you to enter a path to the xml-file to keep the contents
		of the book and a name for the book. The book is added at the end of the list of books on
		finishing the wizard.</p>
		
		<p><em>Note that when an existing file is selected, the file will be overwritten (a warning will be given).
		Note also that the contents of the regular expression library are only persisted on saving a regular expressino entry 
		or on regular shut-down of the workbench. The file holding the contents of the new book will thus not be immediatly visible 
		after creatino of the book.</em></p>
					    
		<a name="workingBook"><h3>Working with Books</h3></a>
		
		<p>Apart from the default book in the library, which is read-only, all books have the context-menu shown
		below.</p>
		
		<img alt="The Reg. Exp. Library Book-context menu" src="images/reLibBookContextMenu.png"/></img>

		<p>From this menu you can:
		<ul>
			<li>add a new category at the top of the list of current categories in the book</li>
			<li>rename the book</li>
			<li>change the path of the xml-file holding the books contents</li>
			<li>delete the book</li>
		</ul>		
		</p>
		
		<a name="workingCategory"><h3>Working with Categories</h3></a>
		
		<p>Apart from the categories in the default book in the library, which are read-only, all categories have the context-menu shown
		below.</p>
		
		<img alt="The Reg. Exp. Library Category-Context menu" src="images/reLibCategoryContextMenu.png"/></img>

		<p>From this menu you can:
		<ul>
			<li>add a new regular expressino entry at the top of the list of current entries in the category</li>
			<li>add a category directly after the current category</li>
			<li>rename the category</li>
			<li>delete the category</li>
		</ul>
