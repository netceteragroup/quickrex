<h2>Why QuickREx?</h2>

<h3>For Testing Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Regular Expressions are powerful but
can be confusing at times. I regularly found myself working with scrapbook-pages to test my regular
expressions (or working late-night shifts to fix problems in production :-( ). QuickREx was written
to get around using scrapbook pages or working on the high-wire and to be able to play with regular expressions
more easily.</p>

<p>QuickREx gives you a view in which you can enter test-texts and try regular expressions. The expressions are
evaluated against the test-text on the fly, matches are highlighted and you can navigate between the matches.
You can also navigate through groups within each match (if groups are defined in your regular expression).</p>

<p>Regular Expressions are edited either within the view or within a composition-dialog which offers the most
useful building-blocks grouped in categories and accompanied by short explanations.</p>

<p>QuickREx also offers TAB-completion for regular expressions and conversion of regular expressions to Java-Strings
(including e.g. proper escaping of the ubiquitous backslash). All TAB-completion suggestions as well as
the corresponding help-text popups are customizable. They are defined in .xml-files distributed with the
plug-in. These files can be changed to add additional hints, remove rarely used hints or change the descriptions.</p>

<p>See <A href="completions.html">here</A> for details on how to customize TAB-completion and the contents of the categories in the reg-exp-edit-dialog.</p>

<p>QuickREx offers the most widely used implementations of Regular Expressions in the Java-world:</p>
<ul>
<li>JDK Regular Expressions (available since 1.4) - see <A href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">java.sun.com</A></li>
<li>Jakarta ORO Perl-style Regular Expressions (ORO-Version 2.0.8, supports Perl 5.003 Regular Expressions) - see <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html" target="_blank">jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html</A></li>
<li>Jakarta ORO Awk-style Regular Expressions (ORO-Version 2.0.8) - see <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html" target="_blank">jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html</A></li>
<li>JRegex Regular Expressions (Version 1.2_01, supports Perl 5.6 Regular Expressions) - see <A href="http://jregex.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">jregex.sourceforge.net/</A></li>
<li>Jakarta-Regexp Regular Expressions (Version 1.4) - see <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html" target="_blank">jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html</A></li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the implementations, you can set the available compiler-flags through QuickREx or use
inline flag-switches with the regular expression (where supported).</p>

<p>See <A href="quickRExView.html#selectingImpl">here</A> for how to select an implementation.</p>

<p>Regular Expressions and Test-Texts can be persisted for later reference. Also, any file-contents can be loaded 
as test-text.</p>

<p>See <A href="quickRExView.html">here</A> for screen-shots and details on using the QuickREx-view.</p>

<h3>For Keeping and Organizing Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Version 3 adds another feature to the plugin: The Regular Expression Library. 
The Library it thought to be a tool to keep, organize, and search for regular expressions
which you may want to use again. There are a few selected expressions for things such as
checking date-formats, finding tags or searching for and matching lines in text containing 'FOO' and 'BAR'
(and maybe neither 'FAR' nor 'BOO'). You can add your own books with chapters holding regular expressions
useful to you.</p>

<p>The Regular Expression Library comes with an editor where you can enter the expression (with 
TAB-completion as you are used from QuickREx), enter a test-text and a description and also enter
a source (you may have found the expression in a book or on a web-page). Also, you can use the QuickREx-view
to test the expression against the saved test-text.</p>

<p>The Regular Expression Library is fully searchable, the entries are kept in XML-files (one for each book)
where the path's are at your choice (apart from the standard book wich is delivered with the plugin).</p>

<p>See <A href="reLibView.html">here</A> for screen-shots and details on using the library.</p>

<h3>For using Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Another feature I am missing from time to time when working on Wintel-boxes is the good old 'grep' command.</p>

<p>QuickREx also offers this feature: Load your test-text, enter or load the 
regular expression you want and press the 'Grep'-button. QuickREx opens a dialog containing only the
matches separated by line-breaks.</p>

<p>This can be useful e.g. when you need to look at large log-files where you are only interested
in lines starting like 'ERROR'. (Of course, you could have used Log4j and adjusted the log-level in the
first place ;) )</p>

<p>See <A href="quickRExView.html#grepping">here</A> for details.</p>

<h2>I'd like the plugin in my own language, please...</h2>

<p>As of Version 3.0.0, QuickREx supports internationalization (I18N). There is a fragment (QuickREx_I18N) with a 
Japanese Version - translated by Takahiro Shida - which you can install from the 
standard QuickREx update-site.</p>

<p>If you are interested in other language translations you are very welcome to provide contributions to 
the fragment, which is also under EPL, v 1.0. You can get the source of Version 1.0.0
<A href="http://www.bastian-bergerhoff.com/eclipse/features/download/QuickREx_I18N/QuickREx_I18Nsrc_1_0_0.zip">here</A>
as a zip-file for download.</p>
